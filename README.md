# neural_sim_measures
Code for Measures of Neural Similarity

Each study folder (GS_study and NI_study) contains two scripts: one script for performing the neural similarity analysis per region of interest and one for performing the searchlight analysis. The most commented script is the neural_sim_per_roi_NI.py script in the NI_study folder, so please look at that first to get a basic understanding. Installing PyMVPA (http://www.pymvpa.org/) should get you all the requirements you need to run the scripts.
